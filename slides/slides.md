# Securing MCP Servers

1. A brief history
    1. A timeline
    1. The decision: oauth2
    1. New stuff lol
1. All about OAuth2
    1. How oauth2 works
    1. In MCP land
    1. Spring AI integration
    1. No token passthrough üò±
1. Notable alternative: API keys
    1. Demo
    1. Drawbacks

# The spec: use OAuth2

- **MCP Server** == OAuth2 Resource Server
    - => Authorizes with valid JWT tokens

- **MCP Client** == OAuth2 Client
    - => Requests tokens on behalf of user

- An **OAuth2 Authorization Server**
    - Validates user identity, issues tokens

# It's Complicated‚Ñ¢

&nbsp;

Noone fully implements the whole stack. The complexity is still very high.

<br>

It's early! It _will_ change.

# OAuth 2 & 2.1

<br>

- An *Authorization* framework
  - Goal: Grant **applications** the **permission** to access **ressources** through **HTTP**.
- Using *tokens*, in this case `access_token`
- A long list of specs
  - **https://oauth.net/specs/** (sometimes a bit ... dry ...)

---

# OAuth 2 & 2.1

For example:

üßëüèª **Daniel**

authorizes

üñ•Ô∏è **my-photo-book.example.com**

to access his pictures hosted on

üì∏ **Google Photos**

(without sharing his üîê Google password)

---

# OAuth 2 & 2.1: for MCP clients

For example:

üßëüèª **Daniel**

authorizes

üñ•Ô∏è [**Claude Desktop** | ChatGPT | Cursor]

to [access resources | call tools | ...] on

üì∏ **Awesome Company MCP Server**

(without sharing his üîê Company password)

# It's all about trust

&nbsp;

There are many relationships between actors, with varying levels of trust.

The client <> server relation **MUST** be trusted.

# Client <> Auth Server trust

&nbsp;

Two options:

- The MCP Client is pre-registered with the Auth Server
    - Local app (Claude Desktop, Cursor, ...)
    - Remote app (Spring AI, ...)
- The MCP Client is _not_ pre-registered
    - OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration
