# Why authorization?

&nbsp;

Ensure that:
- User is known to the system
- User can see only their resources
- User has permission to perform an action
- System is auditable
- ...

---

# Some AI apps we'll use

&nbsp;

- Claude Code
- MCP inspector
    - Not an AI app, only does the MCP client part!

But also Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, ...

# The spec: use OAuth2

- **MCP Server** == OAuth2 Resource Server
    - => Authorizes with valid JWT tokens

- **MCP Client** == OAuth2 Client
    - => Requests tokens on behalf of user

- An **OAuth2 Authorization Server**
    - Validates user identity, issues tokens

---

# It's Complicated‚Ñ¢

- OAuth 2.1 IETF DRAFT (draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13)
- OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata (RFC8414)
- OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol (RFC7591)
- OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata (RFC9728)
- Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0 (RFC8707)
- JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens (RFC9068)

# It's (very) Complicated‚Ñ¢

&nbsp;

This is still very new:

- Noone truly implements the whole stack
- Interoperability needs improvement
- Too complex for developers, too many failure modes
- It _will_ change

# OAuth 2 & 2.1

<br>

- An *Authorization* framework
  - Goal: Grant **applications** the **permission** to access **ressources** through **HTTP**.
- Using *tokens*, in this case `access_token`
- A long list of specs
  - **https://oauth.net/specs/** (sometimes a bit ... dry ...)

---

# OAuth 2 & 2.1

For example:

üßëüèª **Daniel**

authorizes

üñ•Ô∏è **my-photo-book.example.com**

to access his pictures hosted on

üì∏ **Google Photos**

(without sharing his üîê Google password)

---

# OAuth 2 & 2.1: for MCP clients

For example:

üßëüèª **Daniel**

authorizes

üñ•Ô∏è [**Claude Desktop** | ChatGPT | Cursor]

to [access resources | call tools | ...] on

üì∏ **Awesome Company MCP Server**

(without sharing his üîê Company password)

# It's all about trust

&nbsp;

There are many relationships between actors, with varying levels of trust.

The client <> server relation **MUST** be trusted.

# Client <> Auth Server trust

&nbsp;

Two options:

- The MCP Client is pre-registered with the Auth Server
    - Great for remote app (Spring AI, ...), with known MCP servers
- The MCP Client is _not_ pre-registered
    - Needs OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration
    - Better UX for local apps
